# JSON Explorer
This script can be used to explore JSON files in your terminal in an interactive TUI.
This can be useful when working with amounts of data too big for regular JSON Viewers like [this one](https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer) or when you prefer working inside your terminal.

# Quickstart
To install this tool just run

```bash
pip install git+
```
